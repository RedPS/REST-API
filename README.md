# REST-API

So far we were able to

- Use different packages
- Create Routes
- Create Middlewares
- Organize our routes by putting them in a different folder
- Calling our routes from another folder
- Connect to mongoDB
- Create an env file to hide our database connection detail
- Create Data and store it in the database

### TODO:

- Use postman, get familiar with the functionalities
- Organize stuff better
- play around with more packages
